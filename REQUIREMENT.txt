Project Title: Gait-Based Emotion Recognition using DenseNet121

Overview:
This project uses the DenseNet121 deep learning model to recognize human emotions based on gait patterns. The source code is written in Python and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook format.

---------------------------
1. How to Run the Code (Recommended: Google Colab)
---------------------------

Step 1: Open the following link to access Google Colab:
https://colab.research.google.com/

Step 2: Upload the notebook file:
- Click "File" > "Upload Notebook"
- Select the file: Gait-DenseNet121.ipynb

Step 3: Upload your dataset:
- Use the folder icon on the left panel to upload your dataset (or mount Google Drive if needed).
- Make sure the file paths in the notebook match your uploaded dataset location.

Step 4: Run the code:
- Click “Runtime” > “Run all”
- Follow any prompts or instructions that appear.

---------------------------
2. Requirements (Automatically Handled in Colab)
---------------------------
The following libraries are used in the notebook and will be installed automatically in Google Colab:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---------------------------
3. Notes
---------------------------
- Ensure that your dataset is structured correctly.
- If training is slow, go to “Runtime” > “Change runtime type” and select **GPU** as the hardware accelerator.
